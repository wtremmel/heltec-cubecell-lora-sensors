Solar powered weather station based on CubeCell hardware

## Cabling
This is a reminder to myself...
- Cable with pins goes on the microcontroller (powre and sensors)
- Cable with plugs goes on the device (solar cell or sensor)
- Sensor cable is like follows
  - red for power
  - black for ground
  - white for SCL
  - yellow for SDA
